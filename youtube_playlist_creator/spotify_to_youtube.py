'''
Ideally should just pass playlist url or something here, thinking will have a search 
playlist/album feature on the site, people can just search what they want and have a 
youtube playlist made for them.

Pass playlist ID here, get a list of songs as strings
Search the strings on youtube, grab the first result, it's likely most relevant, then add the 
result to a new playlist on my page.
Need to check if my page already has the playlist in the exact same order.
